Description: Teruhashi 

Your DNA results reveal your child has a high chance for an anti-social personality disorder.  
The 5th chromosome is mutated to be slightly shorter, causing delayed frontal cortex development. 
There is also a high chance of a miscoloration in the hair pigments to have a blue color from a lack of
melanocortin receptor. 


Description: Rem 

Your DNA results reveal your child has a stunted growth height averaging below 4 feet.  This 
is caused by the 3rd autosomal chromosome having a premature separation in the 2nd meiotic phase.  Hair 
color is altered by the mutation an extra insertion of the melanocortin receptor.

Description: Goku

Your DNA results reveal your child to have extensive muscular development from an extra pair of a 20th chromosome.
The extra pair will also have a tendency for neon pigments in the hair coloration when the amygdala is activated.


Description: Tanjirou 

DNA results show this child to have a large scar in the left forhead, caused by an abnormality in the 
3rd chromosome to have a large deletion of purines. The eyes of the child are larger than usual from extra 
insertions of cytosine in the 3rd chromosome. 

Descripton: Tohsaka Rin

DNA results conclude that the child has extensive amygdala development to cause aggressive behavior. 
The increase in the 2nd genes pairing of Adenine and Guanine cause the growth rate of the amygdala to 
alter.  The long legs is assosciated with mutations in cytosine counts in the 8th chromosome.
